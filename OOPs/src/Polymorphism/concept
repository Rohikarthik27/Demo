Polymorphism:

-> Polymorphism contains two words "poly" and "morphs". Poly means many, and morph means shape/forms.
-> Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
-> one task can be performed in different ways.  


2 Types of Polymorphism:

1. Compile time Polymorphism (Method overloading)(Static Polymorphism):
	It is a type of Polymorphism which can be achieved at java compilation time.
	
2. Run time Polymorphism (Method overriding)(Dynamic Polymorphism):
	It is a type of Polymorphism which can be achieved at java runtime/execution time.
	
	
Method Overloading:
-> If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

Method Overriding:
-> If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
