Class:

The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.

Object:
The object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.


Inheritance:

-> It is a mechanism in which one class can accquries all the properties and behaviour of another class with the specific releatonship.
-> It specifies that the child object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object.
-> The new class is known as a derived class or child class, and the one whose properties are acquired is known as a base class or parent class.
-> It provides the re-usability of the code.


Types of Inheritance:
1. Multiple Inheritance
2. Multi level Inheritance-  Multi-level inheritance is archived when a derived class inherits another derived class.

-> In Inheritance we can cannot implement Multiple Inheritance in class level. But we can implement the multiple inheritance at interface level.

-> Super Keyword- To access the parent properties we will use super keyword.
