Encapsulation:

-> It is used to restrict access to methods and variables. 
-> In encapsulation, code(Actions, behaviour) and data(Variables) are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.
-> Best example: Class

-> We will be using access modifiers like private.
-> Private will access within the class.
Eg: Private a;
-> Variable 'a' can access within the class. we cannot access from another class.
-> By using the methods we are securing the data based on methods.
-> based on methods we are giving access to the objects.
